# Cucumber Disease #3 - "Data Collector":

## Description
The “Data Collector” code smell occurs within your “Given” steps in Gherkin scenarios.
It’s related to the use of the Builder pattern, where you set the values of fields incrementally across multiple steps.
By passing data piece by piece, this pattern leads to long scripts with individual steps for each field.

## Impact
* Script Length: The scenario becomes verbose due to numerous steps dedicated to setting field values.
* Complexity: Readers must follow a sequence of steps to understand the complete data setup.
* Maintenance Overhead: Any change to the domain object requires updating multiple steps.
* Coupling: The coupling between scenarios and step implementation increases, especially when the order of steps matters. Changes in one step may ripple through others, affecting the entire scenario.

## Your taks
Find the “Data Collector” in the customer.feature file. Replace the multiple 'Given' steps with a single step that passes the entire data object (from the same domain) at once.
