# Cucumber Disease #2 - "Unused Given Parameter":

## Description
This code smell occurs when a field or property is initialized within a “Given” step but remains unused throughout the scenario.
Essentially, it’s like setting up a variable or resource but never actually utilizing it in subsequent steps.

Possible reasons include:
* Redundancy: The parameter duplicates information already available elsewhere.
* Obsolete Logic: The parameter was relevant in an earlier version of the scenario but is no longer necessary.
*Incomplete Implementation: The parameter was added but not fully integrated into the scenario.

## Impact
* Unused parameters clutter the scenario and add unnecessary complexity.
* They can mislead readers into thinking that the parameter plays a crucial role in the scenario.
* Maintenance becomes harder as unused parameters accumulate over time.

## Your task
In our code there is a field/property which is initialized by a step but never used afterwards. Find this field, analyze why it is not used and decide either to remove it or to use it. Decide whether to:
* **Remove It**: If the parameter serves no purpose, eliminate it.
* **Use It**: If the parameter has a valid role, ensure it’s utilized appropriately.
