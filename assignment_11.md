# Cucumber Disease #11 - "Dependent on Class State"

## Description
This code smell occurs when everything is stored either in a context or in the fields of your step implementation. Often, this state is even duplicated because we prepared the state of the application previously. This can lead to tightly coupled tests that are difficult to maintain and understand.

## Impact
* Readability: Tests become harder to understand as the state of the application is scattered across multiple locations.
* Maintainability: Changes to the system under test may require extensive modifications to step definitions, increasing maintenance effort.
* Coupling: Tests become tightly coupled to the system's state, making them less reusable and more prone to breaking. Further they become less reliable if the state of the application is not properly managed or controlled.
* Complexity: The codebase becomes more complex and difficult to manage due to the use of class state over different steps.

## Your task

TODO: describe details of exercise

* **Pass Data Explicitly**: Reduce the reliance on class state by passing data directly to step definitions as parameters.
* **Avoid Premature Data Gathering**: Gather data only when needed. If data can be collected later in the scenario, defer its retrieval to a later step and pass it to the subsequent steps as necessary.
* **Reuse Application State**: Don't hold data twice in your application and in your test classes. Prefer the usage of test data in your application state for example a database instead of temporary storage in your objects.
* **Use Scenario Context Sparingly**: While scenario context can be useful, avoid overusing it. Limit the amount of data stored in the context to essential information. Consider whether a step really needs access to the entire context or if a smaller subset suffices.
