# Diagnosis and Treatment of Cucumber Diseases

Java implementation of the Cucumber Diseases workshop

## Installation
For the workshop Java 17 or later is a pre-requisite for building und runnnig the Cucumber features. It needs to be installed before the local setup.

### Local

* Clone the repository localy
* Import the repository in your favourite IDE and configure the Maven build
* Install a Cucumber extension or plugin in you IDE
   * IntelliJ IDEA: https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/cucumber-support.html
   * VS Code: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=CucumberOpen.cucumber-official
   * Eclipse: https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/cucumber-eclipse-plugin

#### Platform notes
The VC Code Cucumber extension fails on any Unix distribution. It's recommended to use VS Code on Windows.

Restrictions of missing Cucumber extension on Unix:
* You won't have Gherkin support
* You can't generate step definition
* There is NO linkage between your feature files and step definition implementation
* You are still able to edit all file and execute your Unit Tests.

### gitpod.io
Since gitpod.io uses Linux, the same restrictions as on any other Unix distribution apply.

1. [Login to GitHub](https://github.com/login) or [create an account](https://github.com/join).

2. [Create a new workspace at Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/new/#https://github.com/rolger/cucumber-diseases-java).
   This usually takes a little while, just be patient.

3. At the bottom there is a Terminal window executing the Maven build the of project. Wait until _BUILD SUCCESS_ apprears in the log.
  
5. Open  from the file tree on the left and wait for the Java installation to finish.

6. After the installation is done, you can open files via the Java Project explorer, edit the code, and select _Run Tests_ on either the test folder or the _RunAllCucumberTests_ class file.
